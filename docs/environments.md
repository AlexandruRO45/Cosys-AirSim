# Environments

Multiple environments are available within the Cosys-Lab version of AirSim. To keep the data-usage on our GitLab server to a minimum, asset files (textures, 3D models, ...) are not save to GIT
but are kept elsewhere and need to manually downloaded and installed. Here is a list of download links for some of the environments, if a link is missing contact a Cosys-Lab researcher.
