# Instance Segmentation in AirSim

An Instance segmentation system is implemented into AirSim. It uses Vertex Color rendering to get allow for each object in the world to get its own color.

## Limitations
* Only 2097152â€¬ different colors are currently available. More are technically possible to implement in future but likely unnecessary. 
* Landscape objects aren't supported. This is the special object type in Unreal to make terrain with. As a work-around, StaticMesh terrain must be used.
* Foliage objects aren't supported. This is a the special object type in Unreal to place trees, grass and other plants that move with the wind. As a work-around, StaticMesh objects must be used.
* These and other unsupported object types that are less common (decals, text,...) will by default be given the RGB color value of [76,76,76].

## Usage
By default, at the start of the simulation, it will give a random color to each object. 
Please see the [Image API documentation](image_apis.md#segmentation) on how to manually set or get the color information.

The easiest way to get the images from segmentation cameras, is through ros. See the [ROS documentation](ros.md) for more information. 

For an example of the Instance Segmentation API, please see the script  [segmentation_config.py](../ros/python_ws/src/airsim/scripts/segmentation_config.py).
